# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of the new analysis is to examine the ride-sharing data by city type, and to provide useful recommendations to management based on the analysis.

## Results
1. The urban setting brings in the most total fares, has the most number of drivers, and provides the most rides when compared to the suburban and rural city types. However, the urban city type has the lowest average fare per driver and lowest average fare per ride.

2. Both the suburban and rural city types provided more rides than there are drivers. However, the urban city type has more drivers than total rides provied in the urban setting.

3. Due to the higher number of urban drivers compared to the total number of urban rides, the average fare for the urban driver is lower than the average fare per ride. Both the suburban and rural city types have a higher average fare per driver than average fare per ride.

4. The urban city type provides the most total rides, has the most total drivers, and brings in the most total fares. It, by far, brings in the most total fares month over month as evidenced in our graph.

5. The rural city type brings in the least fares consistently month over month.

## Summary
Overall, these are 3 very different city types so I would expect to see a variation in total fares, total drivers, and total rides. The total fares by city type graph suggests each city type is busier at the same times. 
1. I would suggest additional analysis in the urban setting to determine if it is detrimental to be providing less total rides than there are total drivers. This could suggest that drivers have a hard time getting rides assigned and will seek employment elsewhere. It could also be that we have a lot of drivers signed up, but not all are actually on the streets looking to provide rides.
2. I would also suggest additional analysis on the number of missed rides, where a driver was not available, per city type. This will help us understand if there is an unmet need in a particular city type.
3. It may be beneficial to ask some of the urban drivers to take some suburban rides, and some suburban drivers to take some rural rides, if they want additional fares. Having a higher driver density in the suburban and urban city types may also increase the demand as the ease of catching a ride in these areas increases, and people get used to the convenience of the ride-sharing service.
